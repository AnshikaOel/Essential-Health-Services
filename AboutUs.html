      <p>The main objective of this Website is providing all essential services related to COVID-19 under a single platform like blood, oxygen, food, medicine. As we have seen the situation in the COVID-19 crisis many people or we can say most of our population has issue in getting blood, Oxygen, medicine. In many house/families, the whole family was tested COVID positive, so there was issue with the food. So, in this website we will provide food as well. The main thing is that all these things will be provided by NGOs in free. If anyone wants to donate for website, he/she can donate as well, as much as they want to donate. </p>
